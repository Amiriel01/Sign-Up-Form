1. Turtle image with logo overlay
2. First and Last Names are required to be less than 20 characters long
3. Email Address must be formatted correctly
4. Phone Number can be entered in any countries format
5. Password and Confirm Password must be at least five characters long and match. 
6. User will receive one of three messages depending on passwords entered once they click the "Create Account" button. 
(Once the site is operational this button would submit the form data if the passwords matched.)
    a. **Error: The password field is Empty.
    b. **Success: Account Created!
    c. **Error: The password field is Empty.
7. If user already has an account there is a "Login Here!" link that would take them to the login page once the site was operational.
